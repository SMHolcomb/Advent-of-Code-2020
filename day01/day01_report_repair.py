###  PART 1 ####

# After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. 
# Surely, Christmas will go on without you.

# The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have 
# a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem 
# to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.

# To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

# Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; 
# the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

# Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, 
# something isn't quite adding up.

# Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

# For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

# 1721
# 979
# 366
# 299
# 675
# 1456
# In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.

# Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

# --- Part Two ---
# The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

# Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.

# In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
